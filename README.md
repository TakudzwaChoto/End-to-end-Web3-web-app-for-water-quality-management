## Water Quality Management System

### Overview
The **Water Quality Management System** is an innovative project developed using **Flask** and **Web3** technologies. This system integrates mechanisms similar to **Hyperledger** to facilitate effective water quality management. It enables government authorities to validate water quality, while participants can receive incentives or pay penalties based on their water management practices.

### Features
- **Water Quality Validation**: Utilizes **MetaMask** for government validation of water quality standards.
- **Incentives and Penalties**: Participants can earn incentives for good water quality and incur penalties for violations.
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Automates judgment on water quality data, determining eligibility for incentives or penalties.
- **Comprehensive Water Management**:
  - **Water Supply**
  - **Water Discharge**
  - **Water Trade**
  - **Water Treatment**

### Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Flask
- **Blockchain**: Web3, Alchemy, Sepolia
- **Smart Contracts**: For automated decision-making based on water quality data
- **Database**: SQL for efficient data storage and retrieval
- **Security**: Cryptography to ensure secure transactions and data integrity

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
